    <h2>
      Why was the application we built on intro-to-express.js so important?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Understanding this basic cycle of handling request and response is part of
      any application. All applications handle some form of user request and
      response.
    </p>
    <h3>What do we do inbetween these requests and responses</h3>
    <p>
      Think of the http request lifecycle as a sandwich, you have the incoming
      request as the bottom bun and the server's response as the top bun. The
      meat of the sandwich would be the "if" statements used in our application.
      Now it's about adding more interesting features into the middle.
    </p>

    <h2>
      What is the missing ingredient that will let us build more advance
      applications?
    </h2>
    <h5>That would be databases!</h5>
    <p>
      Databases allow us to permanently create, read, update, delete input data.
      Databases help make anything you say or do on the internet permanent.
    </p>
    <h2>What are we going to do for the remainder of this course?</h2>
    <p>
      In order to understand databases, we are going to create 2 applications
      for the rest of this course:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Application #1: A To-Do App: small, unorganised, and oversimplified
      </li>
      <li>
        Application #2: A Journal/Writing Social Network App: big, organised,
        and real-world
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Both applications use database to store information. In application #1, it
      is just to-do list items. In application #2, the database is storing
      username, passwords, article post, user-relations, etc.
