/*
"Express" is a compilation of pre-written JavaScript code we can leverage in recreating new or existing applications
Think of "Node.js" as basic lego blocks and "Express" as additional lego block types, specific to building a web server
To install "express", we go to npm (supermarket) in the terminal:
    By typing "npm install express" to download the "express" package
    npm will automatically create a "node_modules" folder with "express" and its dependencies
Important to note: the "express" package will always install on your current terminal current directory
*/

const express = require("express") // Node will look for the express module
