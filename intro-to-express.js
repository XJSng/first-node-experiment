/*
Express is a pre-written JavaScript code we can leverage so that we don't recreate existing applications
Think of Node.js as basic lego blocks and Express as new lego block types, specific to building a web server
To install express we go to npm (supermarket) to install express
By typing "npm install express" to download the express package
npm will automatically create a "node_modules" folder with express and its dependencies
Important to note: the express package will be installed on your terminal's current directory.

const express = require("express") // Node will look for the express module
